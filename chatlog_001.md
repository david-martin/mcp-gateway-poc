# Developer Summary: MCP Gateway Adventure 🚀

*TL;DR: What started as "let's make 3 Go servers" turned into a surprisingly smooth ride with only a few entertaining detours. Read time: ~1 minute*

## The Journey in Bullets

• **Initial Ask**: Build an MCP Gateway in Go that routes requests to 2 test servers. All 3 servers need MCP protocol support.

• **First Success**: 🎯 Project structure nailed on first try - gateway in root, 2 test servers in subfolders, proper Go modules, working build script.

• **The Transport Confusion Dance**: 💃
  - AI initially assumed SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport because most examples use stdio
  - User corrected: "Actually, let's use HTTP transport"  
  - AI: "Sure!" *proceeds to build basic HTTP endpoints instead of proper MCP transport*
  - Took a few iterations to understand that "HTTP transport" meant "streamable HTTP MCP protocol" not just "HTTP endpoints"

• **The Great Mux Detour**: 🛤️
  - AI spent multiple iterations building custom HTTP handlers with `http.ServeMux`
  - Completely bypassed the mcp-go server library and rolled own JSON-RPC handling
  - User had to provide actual MCP server example code: "Here, look at this..."
  - Also shared MCP client example code for the gateway implementation
  - AI: "Ohhh, THAT'S how you use the library!" *facepalm*
  - Classic case of overthinking instead of just using the actual API

• **Version Compatibility Plot Twist**: 📚
  - Used mcp-go v0.32.0 which requires Go 1.23+
  - Build failures led to proper version requirements documentation
  - AI learned to check compatibility before suggesting libraries

• **The "Simple" Server Implementations**: 🛠️
  - Server1: echo + timestamp tools → Actually straightforward
  - Server2: dice_roll + magic 8-ball → Also smooth sailing
  - Both servers worked on first implementation (rare W)

• **Gateway Implementation Drama**: 🎭
  - First attempt: "Let's just proxy to server1" (totally missed the aggregation requirement)
  - User steered: "We need tool aggregation and session management"
  - AI had lightbulb moment and built proper MCP client/server hybrid
  - Session management required understanding `mcp-session-id` headers

• **API Documentation Adventures**: 📖
  - AI initially wrote TODOs for "implement proper transport" when it was already implemented
  - Had to clean up documentation to reflect actual working state
  - Multiple README updates to match reality vs. wishful thinking

• **Testing Validation Victory**: ✅
  - Final testing showed everything actually worked perfectly
  - 5 tools aggregated, session management working, request routing flawless
  - README commands were 100% accurate (rare achievement!)

## Success Metrics
- **Back & Forth Intensity**: Medium-High (several detours but good recovery)
- **"AI Got Confused" Moments**: 4-5 (transport protocol, mux vs library, documentation accuracy)
- **"User Had to Provide Code Examples" Moments**: 2 (MCP server + client examples)
- **"User Had to Steer" Moments**: 3-4 (tool aggregation, API usage, cleanup tasks)
- **Final State**: 🏆 Fully functional MCP Gateway with proper protocol implementation

## Funny Highlights
- AI spent way too long building custom `http.ServeMux` handlers instead of just using the mcp-go library 🤦‍♂️
- User had to literally share example code: "Here, this is how you actually use the API"
- AI kept writing "TODO: implement MCP transport" comments even after implementing it
- Magic 8-ball response to "Will this README work perfectly?": "It is certain" (and it did!)
- Multiple "clean up the TODOs" requests because AI loves leaving breadcrumbs for future work

**Bottom Line**: Surprisingly smooth for a complex distributed system build. AI nailed the architecture early but needed occasional reality checks on what was already implemented vs. what still needed work.
